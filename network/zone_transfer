A not really dutiful administrator has set up a DNS service for the "ch11.challenge01.root-me.org" domain...
Challenge connection informations
Host	challenge01.root-me.org
Protocol	DNS
Port	54011



Ok. We only have to do a zone tranfer:

In linux, we can't tranfer zone with nslookup. 

We can use host, dig, or some other. 

I'm going to use dig.

So, we need to tranfer ch11.challenge01.root-ne....

The host is challenge.root-me.org so:

dig @challenge01.root-me.org -p 54011 axfr ch11.challenge01.root-me.org

AN we have the flag
