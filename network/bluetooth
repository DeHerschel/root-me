Statement:
Your friend recovered an unreadable file from a hackerâ€™s computer. The only thing he knows is that it comes from a communication between a computer and a phone.

The answer is the sha-1 hash of the concatenation of the MAC address (uppercase) and the name of the phone.

Example:
AB:CD:EF:12:34:56myPhone -> 023cc433c380c2618ed961000a681f1d4c44f8f1

We have a bin file. We can try to open it with wireshark because is abluetooth capture.
After open it, we have a lot of lines, but i see two interesting lines: 

1	0.000000	controller	host	HCI_EVT	13	Rcvd Connect Request
2	0.000995	controller	host	HCI_EVT	7	Rcvd Command Status (Accept Connection Request)

In the first packet (the phone trying to connect), we should be able to find the MAC
so let's to see it: 
Frame 1: 13 bytes on wire (104 bits), 13 bytes captured (104 bits)
Bluetooth
Bluetooth HCI H4
Bluetooth HCI Event - Connect Request
    Event Code: Connect Request (0x04)
    Parameter Total Length: 10
    BD_ADDR: SamsungE_b9:4f:c6 (0c:b3:19:b9:4f:c6)
    Class of Device: 0x5a020c (Phone:Smartphone - services: Networking Capturing ObjectTransfer Telephony)
    Link Type: ACL connection (Data Channels) (0x01)

So we have the MAC. Now we need the bluetooth name of the phone. For that, we can 
try to find something in the capture file. 


8	0.166012	controller	host	HCI_EVT	7	Rcvd Command Status (Remote Name Request)
9	0.184990	controller	host	HCI_EVT	258	Rcvd Remote Name Request Complete

So, it apopears one of this packet contains the name. Let's see it:

Frame 9: 258 bytes on wire (2064 bits), 258 bytes captured (2064 bits)
Bluetooth
Bluetooth HCI H4
Bluetooth HCI Event - Remote Name Request Complete
    Event Code: Remote Name Request Complete (0x07)
    Parameter Total Length: 255
    Status: Success (0x00)
    BD_ADDR: SamsungE_b9:4f:c6 (0c:b3:19:b9:4f:c6)
    Remote Name: GT-S7390G

So we got the name. Now we need to conc and hash to SHA-1:

cho -n "0C:B3:19:B9:4F:C6GT-S7390G" | sha1sum
