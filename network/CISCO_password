We have the cisco config file. In it there are the following
interesting lines:

enable secret 5 $1$p8Y6$MCdRLBzuGlfOs9S.hXOp0.
!
username hub password 7 025017705B3907344E 
username admin privilege 15 password 7 10181A325528130F010D24
username guest password 7 124F163C42340B112F3830
!


It seems that the hub, admin and guest passwords have a weak encryption.
Also, it looks it looks that is a Cisco type of encryption or something like that.

We can search "Cisco password 7", and we'll observe that indeed we can broke
the password. There are several pages for decrypt Cisco passwords.

After decrypt them, we have got:

	User:	 Password:

	hub      6sK0_hub

	admin    6sK0_admin

	guest    6sK0_guest
	
There is a clear pattern: 6sK0_username. But we need the enable password:

enable secret 5 $1$p8Y6$MCdRLBzuGlfOs9S.hXOp0.

Is a MD5 with salt (p8Y6) . We can identify the hash online with several tools.
If we follow the pattern, the password
could be 6sK0_guest.

We can use openssl to verify:

$ openssl passwd -1 -salt p8Y6 6sK0_enable
$1$p8Y6$MCdRLBzuGlfOs9S.hXOp0.

We have the password.
